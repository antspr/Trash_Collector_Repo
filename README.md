Trash Collector – Django Web Application – 85 points  
You have been brought on to a team building an application for a business specializing in trash collection. The application includes a fully-functional customer side that allows
users to register as customers and utilize the application to start their service. Using the application, customers are able to:

•	Choose a day of the week to get their regular trash picked up

•	Choose a date for an additional, one-time pickup

•	Temporarily suspend their service between two chosen dates

•	Track their current account balance

It is your task to build out the employee-side of this application to allow employees to access relevant customer data to service their area of responsibility.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

‘accounts’ and ‘customers’ apps are complete and will not need to be changed to achieve MVP.

For migrations:

Migration files include a time stamp, so even two partners who migrate the same exact same model properties will get a merge conflict from the timestamp differing.

Have one person in charge of migrations. They change the model, enter the command ‘python manage.py makemigrations’, test it is good by running ‘python manage.py migrate’. If the migration works, they make a new commit to push the created migration file to the repo.

Collaborators will then receive the migration file next time they make a commit and pull. After receiving the file, they will need to run ‘python manage.py migrate’ to have the migration applied to their database.

If you re-clone the repo:
local_settings.py will be gone, be sure to save the one from previous version, or have partner send it over slack if you lost it.
